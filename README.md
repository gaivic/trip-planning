## Edit page:
Need to implement:
1. How to add place to a specific day.
* front: using autocomplete or infowindow?, can the places drug and drop?
* back: add new placeId to specific day (schedule[index])
2. Do we need a save button?
* to update the data in mongo?
   
## Authentication:
How to do?
Do we need user photo?
